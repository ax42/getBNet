getBNet
=======

Fetch SC2 character information from battle.net

Shows position, win rate, wins and losses, and points.
Modify the 'defaultProfiles' array for the profiles you want to look up if no arguments are given.

Works for me under python 2.7 on OS X and requires BeautifulSoup

BUG: nonrandom Multiplayer still crashes the script (due to multiple player names)
